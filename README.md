This repository contains two R markdown notebooks: Prepare_data.Rmd and Analysis.Rmd. For both notebooks, required packages are listed in the code chunk entitled "Load Libraries". In the same code chunk, it is necessary to change the path of the variable "figdir" to point to the folder where figures should be saved and "datadir" to the folder where data are stored. 

Prepare_data.Rmd requires some large data files which can be provided upon request or downloaded from their original public repositories. Sorption experiment data are available in the Sorption_Data.zip file. All of the files generated by Prepare_data.Rmd are included in the repository, so Analysis.Rmd can be run independently of Prepare_data.Rmd.

Analysis.Rmd can be run using the data files included in the repository.
