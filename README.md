This repository contains two R markdown notebooks: Prepare_data.Rmd and Analysis.Rmd.

Analysis.Rmd can be run using the data files included in the repository, after changing the paths of the variables "figdir" and "datadir" to point to the appropriate folder, and after insuring that the required packages are installed.

Prepare_data.Rmd requires data files which can be provided upon reasonable request (sorption datasets) or downloaded from their original public repositories (WoSIS and Soilgrids datasets).
